Introduction and motivation:
                     Despite all the inclusion that the machine learning model and AI (AI) restores applications, AI development is currently a poorly planned process. Software Engineering and AI Development share multiple languages ​​and equal tools, but AI development as an engineering practice remains in the early stages. Mining. The maintenance of software AI models enables an understanding of the current AI Development Situation. However, most of the relevant metadata around the models are not easily accessible directly from the repositories And require a reduction or domain information. This paper has a library called AIMMX that allows AI Model Metadata Extraction to be simplified from the software. The integration of adequate Hardware resources, the delivery of large amounts of information, and innovations in AI (AI) models has resulted in a resurgence in AI research and performance. In this paper, we describe the AI ​​model as all the software and artificial data needed to define a given Task model, to train mathematical tools, and / or to add a weighted model to predict service time or application. Our model definitions include traditional machine learning (ML) and in-depth learning models. AI as an engineering practice is still in its early stages with the usual unpleasant and lovable effects (Both in terms of your time and quality) that are often difficult to produce. How much AI proximity and Algorithms approach and the current increase in AI framework output The result of the type of AI model releases and presentations. Sheer variability and a lack of standard positioning lead to models that are difficult to work with and negotiate to some degree.

This paper does the following:
An AI model metadata specialization tool from software Repositories with five output modules now (Phase 2).
Testing of our tools compared to a database of 7,998 models (section 3). This AI model data is available as part of a duplicate package.
Initial use of metadata extracted using Detailed Analysis of Data and Methods of Re-emergence of AI models in our database and catalog implementation (Section 4).

WARNING BASED ON MELADATA METADATA:
            The core of AIMMX is a Python library that reads software codes, specifically GitHub, and extracts AI model-related information into JMON-formatted computer-readable and human-readable formats. This library is an open source and publicly available for use1. AIMMX is designed to be easy to use: as long as it is embedded in the GitHub API key, the user calls the function with the GitHub URL you want where it runs the extracts and retrieves the extracted metadata. The advantages of choosing to use software and GitHub packs especially are that they are already widely used in AI development.

CONCLUSIONS:

This paper describes AIMMX which we intend as a step towards furthering engineering support for AI development through providing standardized metadata for existing AI models. We envision that generating analyzable metadata for disparate models is both the first step towards managing models at scale and adapting existing mining software repositories techniques to AI models.
